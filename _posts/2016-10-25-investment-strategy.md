`The Initial Plan`

`October 2016`
>Goald: building up capital to live off or have available to use for the acquisition of a (2nd) house, or travel around the world, something like it

**The Plan:** My projection is to achieve an annual return of about 7 to 10%, a market average, longerm. I'll start with a more passive strategy, by periodically (monthly) buying index funds (ETFs). When my portfolio is around €10k, I'll probably start with more active trading, expanding my portfolio with other investment instruments. What these are going to be, I'm not sure. It could be normal stocks, or dividend stocks, most probably no margin trading or the likes. I think one should hold a decent share of ETFs in their portfolio, which could function as a hedge against the volatility of individual stocks. 

>So let me add up, I start with 0 and I want to have 'something' build up any longer than 10 years from now. Let me specify that when I'm there, if ever.

However, we'll see. Next to my ETF strategy, I'll be putting in my retirement investment account, where I can benefit from tax regulations. This retirement fund serves as an addition to my retirement plan, since the pension system in The Netherlands could become unsustainable, hence I'm not sure if I'll get my money by that time. However, if all goes well, then that is no concern anyway :)

I start depositing a monthly of €200-300 and will gradually increase this amount, as far my situation will let me. So let me add up, I start with 0 and I want to have 'something' build up any longer than 10 years from now. Let me specify that when I'm there, if ever.

Later

**T.**
