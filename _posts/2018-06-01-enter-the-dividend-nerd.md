`Enter The Dividend Nerd,`

Where I, Thijs, aspire to be a Dividend Nerd, with the ultimate goal of financial independence. High Yield, Low Payout is our motto, referring to the Dividend Kings. Businesses that have a double-digit long streak of paying Ã¡nd increasing dividends to their shareholders. This leads to the effect known as compounding interest, Albert Einstein said this is the 8th world wonder. 

Dividend investing should be a relative passive investment style, where one does not focus on growth or value, rather looking for a continously growing and stable stream of income. So you can quit working before you reach the lawful retirement age and have a little more of life, pursuing those things you'd love to that. In fact, that could be working, if that's what you really do, but I bet it isn't for the lot of you.

This blog will be my journey to financial independence. It started as a collection of my thoughts, but I thought, wouldn't it be fun to create this rhythm of monthly reviewing dividend stocks and writing about it, so I can backtrack my thougths, keeping me on the right track.

Have fun

Later.

T.
