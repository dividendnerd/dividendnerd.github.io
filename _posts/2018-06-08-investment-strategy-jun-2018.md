`Update June 2018:`

>Goal: to build capital to retire early, where my financial situation won't limit me in pursuing what I'd like to, not **having** to go work every day.

**Evaluation:** I've put my pension investments on the low, since I'm not sure wether the returns will be better than if I pay taxes up front and can leverage the compounding interest effect. I recently switch brokers, after announcing new fees for the platform, it was an easy choice. From a service fee of 0.15% to no service fee at all, only transactions costs. And, since I only buy a stock or two each month, these costs are drastically lower. 

My monthly deposit has risen almost fourfold and I've built up at least something since the end of 2016. So I guess now the time has come. To gather up some dividend stocks, I feel pretty confident since I've got long breath, ain't stupid, know that it will eventually go up, and have seen several crashes in crypto, seeing my investment go from Tesla to Kia ;) Moreover I've been reading up on them a lot and I definitely know I'll make mistakes on the road.

Actually, that's why I'm putting some more effort into my writing. I've started writing notes a long time ago, for several projects, to cool my head, collect my thoughts from over the years. That is the reason for this blog. Now people can follow me (or not) on my journey and to further collect and track my thoughts on the topic. Hoping these notes, posts, or whatever, will make me stick to my plan and do nothing stupid, or do something stupid, learn from it and then use that to better myself.

I've made a list of the books and stuff I read, the tools and other resources I use. You can find those on this blog also: [reading list](https://dividendnerd.github.io/reading-list) & [resources](https://dividendnerd.github.io/resources).

Later

**T.**
