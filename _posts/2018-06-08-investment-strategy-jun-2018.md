`Update June 2018:`

>Goal: to build capital to retire early, where my financial situation won't limit me in pursuing what I'd like to, not **having** to go work every day.

**Evaluation:** I've put my pension investments on the low, since I'm not sure wether the returns will be better than if I pay taxes up front and can leverage the compounding interest effect. I recently switch brokers, after announcing new fees for the platform, it was an easy choice. From a service fee of 0.15% to no service fee at all, only transactions costs. And, since I only buy a stock or two each month, these costs are drastically lower. 

My monthly deposit has risen almost fourfold and I've built up a decent amount, about â‚¬15k since October '16. So I guess now the time has come. To switch to dividend stocks, I feel pretty confident since I've read a lot.

Actually, that's why I'm putting some more effort into my writing. I've started writing notes a long time ago, for several projects, to cool my head, collect my thoughts from over the years. So that's why I'll start a blog and publish it. So people can follow me on my journey and to further collect and track my thoughts on the topic. Hoping these notes, posts, or whatever, will make me stick to my plan and do anything stupid.

I've made a list of the books and stuff I read, the tools and other resources I use. You can find those on this blog also: [reading list](https://tvbrux.github.io/reading-list) & [resources](https://tvbrux.github.io/resources).

Later

**T.**
