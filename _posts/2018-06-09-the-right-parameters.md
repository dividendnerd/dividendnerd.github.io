`The importance of the right parameters`

Screening dividend stocks is usually done using a set of parameters. In a later post I'll lay out how we're using the parameters in the selection process. First, we should find out why we're using these parameters. So let's dive a little deeper to find out. In this post I'll explain some of the parameters I use in dividend stock screening.

### Dividend Yield

Ofcourse, dividend yield itself is an important parameter. Focusing solely on yield however, is a recipe for disaster. 
I aim for an average annual yield of 4.5% to 5% of my total portfolio. My portfolio currently yields about 3.9%, since I just recently started buying dividend stocks. 

A yield of 4.5-5% means $4.50-$5 for each $100 invested. I assume that the rate of inflation will be average on the long-term, so about 3%. Current inflation in The Netherlands however is at the 2% level, but a couple decades ago this has been 3.4%. So our yield should at least beat the historical inflation rate. But what about making money, getting returns, if you're only beating inflation, shouldn't we be aiming for 8%? 
**No** it's not solely about yield, it's about the expected annual growth of the dividend, which makes this strategy important.

>It's not solely about yield, it's about the expected annual growth of the dividend, which makes this strategy important.

### Dividend Growth

The percentage of the dividend that is return to the shareholders should also grow. Why would companies do this? Why would you increase the dividend yield 10% the next year?

Investors view a steady dividend stream as a beacon of trust, companies on the others side, benefit from investors that stick to their stocks and don't sell them at will. This means the stock will, on average, be less volatile. Moreover, if a company returns dividends, that means they don't think they can use that money to create greater returns by finding new business opportunities, acquisitions or other ways to generate returns. These are mainly companies that are boring, meaning they have no exotic market product or service which they exploit, rather they run a stable business where there is a constant consumer demand, ensuring their earnings in a way. For example utitily companies, everyone uses water, recession or not, same goes for food.

>Increasing dividends will satisfy shareholders and keep them to their stock.

So companies earning a stable income, having relative little insecurity, are also the companies able to pay dividends and raise them year after year. In that light, I'll aim for a average annual dividend growth of 10%. This means, that with a yield of 4.7% and a growth rate of 10%, after 10 years, that dividend will return an 11% yield! So that means €10k on a €100k portfolio after ten years. That sounds like something, right?

Below an overview of several different dividend yield percentages and growth rates. Look at what the average total yield is after 10, 15 and 20 years. (Sure, I don't take price and growth rate fluctation in consideration, but bear with me for now).

You see you should not focus on one or the other. It is evident that growth is of importance, but on the other hand a good starting yield also has his benefits. These percentages are pretty realistic by the way.

>It is evident that growth is of importance, but on the other hand a good starting yield also has his benefits.

A 5% yield and growth rate of 8% returns you more than a 10% yield with a 3.4% growth rate. A low growth rate is clearly the worst for your returns. So that's why I aim for a growth rate of at least 5%, on average, and an average of 4.7% yield, for your portfolio. These are lower limits, below these numbers is not where I want to go

### Payout Ratio

The payout ratio is the proportion of dividends paid of the total earnings of a company, expressed in a percentage. So a payout ratio of 50%, means the company pays half their earnings to their shareholders, and uses the other 50% to stash cash, for investment opportunities, research and development and whatever it feels like.
A payout ratio is not fixed and fluctuates since it's a function of a company's earnings. Moreover, paying off debt, depreciations of production machines and all have their effect on the payout ratio. A company can have €200k in earnings, but also have a deprectiation of €100k for their production machines. Let's assume the company pays out €50k in dividend to their shareholders.

50/200= 25% payout ratio, this seems really good, since this parameter indicates that the company has 75% of their earnings to invest, or grow their dividend in the future. It looks financially good. However, when using free cash flow instead of earnings alone, one should use the earnings minus depreciations, since dividends are paid with cash, not earnings!
So then the formula is 50/(200-100) = 50/100 = 50%. Still a solid payout ratio, but still, don't be blind for this. When you're not sure, check out the numbers. Companies know we're looking for these parameters and they'll make sure the stock is as attractive as they can. Being a Dividend Champion is credit no companies wants to lose.

### Other parameters

Ofcourse, there are loads of other parameters that are important for a given context. But, these are fundamental parameters I, and everyone besides me, should use when looking for a potential dividend stock. 

I think by now you can imagine the companies were looking for aren't your cool tech startups with their innovative bio-technological that will revolutionize the world. No, these are stable, boring, blue chip companies that have consistent income streams, able to pay off debts, increase profits and earnings. Moreover, these are companies that are less volatile in general and outperform non-dividend stocks. However, they also recover a little less steep whilst also taking less damage in bear markets. I will write about that a little more in the coming months.

Does this cover everything? No, I bet no one is ever satisfied.

>Does this cover everything? No, I bet no one is ever satisfied.

But for now, I'll lay down on the writing, because I've a lot of questions left which I want to answer. Here are some of them:

* But how do you start
* Doesn't this cost huge amounts of time?
* When can I expect some results?
* How do I know I've got decent portfolio diversification?
* What about taxes?
* What tools should I use?
* And then, **when** do you buy or sell?
* Etc etc..

Later.
