### beginners luck?

The investment strategy I laid out suggested that in December 2018 I should reach 75/25 ratio of dividend stocks/ETFs. So I though, why not start right away? I jumped in like a maniac searching for the right stocks for my portfolio. In my head it was like I needed that distributed portfolio with loads of dividend stocks right away. 

So that's when I dove in.

Based on the parameters I mentioned in the previous post, I'd creater a custom filter in FinViz. One of my favorite tools in screening for good dividend stocks, by the way. This filter looked like this:

|**Parameter**      			  |**Value**           | 
|:------------------- 				| -------------------:| 
| Market Cap     			| Large | 
| Forward P/E   			 | < 20      |  
| Div. Yield 				| Positive (> 0%)      |  
| PEG						| < 3 | 
| Country					| USA      |  
| LT debt/equity 			| < 1      |  
| Return on Equity   		  | > +15%| 
| Payout Ratio  			| < 60%      |  
|EPS growth					| Positive > 0%      |  
| MEPS growth next 5 years   | Positive > 0%   | 

As you can see there are loads of other parameters than I've discussed on my blog. This filter was based on my own readings, input from blogs and most important a friend of mine which introduced me to FinViz stock screener. Moreover, I keep a watchlist in Evernote (my go-to note taking and organizing application) with interesting stocks and ETFs to look out for. This list is greatly fueled by the well-known dividend bloggers, top-10 lists and whatsoever. Finally, my friend also passed me some good stocks to look out to.

This is the resulting list of the FinViz screener:

![FinViz 3]({{site.url}}/images/2018-06-10-finviz-3.png)

I did know where to look for  and  it filtered 46 companies. From this list I've ultimately selected 2 companies in which I now own some shares. 

Subsequently, with the other companies in my list and interesting talks with that friend, I've felt the urge to buy more. It seemed like there were lots of opportunities, on which my brain said `you need to act, now!`. And so I did, feeling quite confident, since I've screened all results for at least my fundamental parameters. Before I knew, I now owned shares in 6 companies. I was like, wow, awesome, I am the proud owner of:

* The Kraft Heinz Company
* Aflac Inc.
* Delta Airlines
* Cisco
* Starbucks 
* The Walt Disney Company

All positions about €1k give or take. That seemed like a good start, considering I'm hoping to end the year with €20k, I'd need about €15k of dividend stocks. However, that was almost 50% already what I own now, doesn't that seem a little rash?

That 



In hindsight the filter is pretty good though, so that's where I'm lucky I guess.
