`Simple guidelines in finding the right stock`

In [this post]({{ site.baseurl }}/the-right-parameters) I wrote about using three basic parameters when you're looking for dividend growth stocks, talking about **yield, dividend growth and payout ratio**. When I got to that point I was struggling with how to start. So I'll tell you how I got started. Oh and by the way, this does not mean I'm all in on dividend growth investing, I strongly believe that a low-cost index fund is the way to go, also for me. I keep struggling with what kind of proportion funds/stocks I should hold, but I'll definitely find my way there.

OK, now to where I started with for the dividend portion of it all.

### Setting up some guidelines

Guidelines are pretty common in life. We see them in different shapes and environments and are called lots of names. For example protocols, guidelines, principles, standard operating procedures (SOP), rules, a code, ground rules, instruction, whatever you name it. They have one thing in common though, they're to determine a course of action. That's what I was lacking in my stock selection process. Therefore I have made a set of guidelines, based on information of experienced, book-writing, FIRE blogging people and **adjusted that to fit into my context.**

Here they come:

1. Does the company have a consistent dividend strategy?
* Is the dividend growth model realistic and sustainable?
* Do they have a solid market position related to the competition?
* Is this the right time to buy?

This is what I came up with, it's possible they change over time, like everything in life, but in this particular order these guidelines are pretty solid and easy to follow. Let's go over them briefly.

#### 1. Does the company have a consistent dividend strategy?

Does the company pay out a dividend consistently and/or do they have a good reason to deviate from it? First of all, nobody knows anything for sure, that is or is not going to happen in the future. 

>We aim for a streak of 5 years or longer, paying **and** growing dividends.

That in mind, a consistent dividend strategy is important for a dividend investor. Since we're counting on that cash return, we want management of a company to pay steadily dividends over the course of time and growing that dividend as much as possible for the company to maintain and grow it's business. I prefer a company that has a clear strategy for it's investors, their shareholders. So we want a company that pays dividend on the regular, with enough cash on hand to grow their business and to withstand the rough times. **We aim for a streak of 5 years or longer, paying and growing dividends**. The longer the streak, the better they score. However, a dividend of <2% and a growth rate of 1% ain't that exciting for us.

#### 2. Is the dividend growth model realistic and sustainable?
Every dividend payment results in a valuation loss of each share. I mean, it's money flowing **out** of the company into shareholders hands. A company should, therefore, be able to grow their earnings and profits and be able to pay out dividends. When a company is paying only 20% of it's profits to shareholders, they can grow that dividend easily with 20% each year without getting in trouble for the next decade. 

>I like to aim for a dividend growth of at least 7.5% and prefer ~12-15%, but no greater than 25%.

I'm assuming their earnings grow on average, along with 'the market', in this case aobut 7,5% growht annually. But when a company pays out >70% of it's profits in dividends and raises their dividends with 20% annually, I reckon they have to cut their dividend back eventually.  With that in mind, I like to aim for a dividend growth of at least 7.5% (assumed market average) and prefer a ~12-15%, but no greater than 25%. Remember I'm in this game to be FIRE as soon as possible and I am going to achieve that with a solid, sustainable investment strategy that will get me there and doesn't burn loads of my hard-earned money. We are going with the boring, stable growth companies that will be with us for the long run.

#### 3. Is this a company with a solid business model and able to withstand bear markets?
This one is the most subjective, but a very important one to an investor. I want to know what I'm investing in, and not only pushing numbers. Therefore, I'd like to think of a hypothetical, but inevitable, financial crisis. When it's there, and it will be, how will this company perform? I want the company to be able to pull through.
 
>It's an essential one, but is also fueled by the psyche of an investor, and therefore could be overstated simply.

Which company will take harder hits, the company that produces packaging for foods and beverages, of the companies producing car-parts? Sometimes, it ain't that simple, of course. But in essence, this is exactly what I think of when executing this step. It's an essential one, but is also fueled by the psyche of an investor, and therefore could be overstated simply. I pose this question to my partner, my friends, random people on the internet and try to get as much perspectives as I can. Be critical, but foremost, don't make it too complicated.

#### 4. Is this the right time to buy?

When should you buy, well. When it comes to long-term investing, it really doesn't matter that much. 

>**Spoiler alert: the hodler wins.**

We know for a fact, that index-investing is pretty straightforward, you choose a low-cost index tracker and let your money do the work. Over the years, the market always goes up, always. And [jlcollinsnh](http://jlcollinsnh.com/2012/04/19/stocks-part-ii-the-market-always-goes-up/) wrote a nice post about this. Spoiler alert: the hodler wins. This is true, even if you're the absolute worst timer in the world, isn't that nice to know. 
So I don't really care about this one, but I do do some trend analysis. If I have a stock I'd like to own, I pull out the charts and plot the 50- and 200-day small moving averages on them and try to identify whether it's value is down- or uptrending. I'd like to see a downtrend, since that generally means the stock will be cheaper the buy, making compounding interest even more attractive. However, an upward trend does not mean I'll buy instantly. Moreover, I use these SMAs to identify trends but don't really act upon them, except when there is a strong upward or downward trend. Then I usually wait a while before I buy, or I just increase my position in my favorite ETFs.

### Am I doing the right thing?
When you're reading and discussing about financial freedom, there are loads and loads of strategies. But moreover, people tend to believe their strategy is the only one that leads to good results. And if I've learned something, it's that dogmatism does not work. You need to be critical, be reflective, be open and discuss. I like to think I challenge my own mind a lot. Is what I think correct, what if everyone else is also right? What can I learn from this? Now I come to write this, it's quite funny actually. I started this blog to become a dividend nerd, however, the more I read, the more I write, the more I discuss, the less sure I become about this whole new thinking. And I think that is a good thing, I never believe there is one truth. How good it may sound, I've always learned that the real answer, or most plausible solution is one with nuance. That's why I try to eat plant-based, but I don't care for animal protein in my diet, or even meat sometimes, because who doesn't like a bucket of hot wings!
However, what I do believe is that everyone can go FIRE and I firmly believe everyone should be considerate of their future AND have a fantastic life now. Don't be mistaken, those things can be pursued in parallel.

Now I'm thinking about what about to write in my next blog, but I think it should be about dividend stocks, right? I still need to show how I came to buying The Walt Disney Company, AT&T and EQM.

I will.

Later.
