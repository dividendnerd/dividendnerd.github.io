`Why does the Dividend Nerd seek FIRE?`

It's funny, in writing all this down, over the last years, I did not touch so deep as to why I seek financial independence and have the ability to retire early (see what I did there?). The idea came when I started earnuing my own money and was not a student anymore, I was an adult, who lived together with his significant other, for years by the way. Now I needed responsibilities, I should save up, to buy a house, being able to withstand unforeseen drawbacks, financially and personally. But I'd never done that, I was a student, never had significant financial problems, and suddenly had to figure it out myself. It took a while before I knew I wanted FIRE in my life.

I was the only one with a steady income, so I provided for most of the rent, groceries and the rest, leaving me with little to save. At least, that's what I told myself. I saved up for holidays and a big expense such as a new laptop, tv and gadgets. I always told myself this was because I was paying for my own university degree, that was an investment in myself, the best I could make (I wasn't wrong though) and that the money would come later and there would be no stress.

Yeah right, that was rightout nonsense ofcourse. I could afford to go on multiple holidays, buy fancy gadgets and not save up a decent amount? That had to change, and it did, of course. I just don't get why it changed exactly, my interest in money, economics has been there all along, however I never acted upon it. So then I started to save up for real.

I started saving money into a regular savings account, with virtually no interest rate (0.5% or something) and every month I saw that money, doing jack shit. It did not make me feel better directly or made my love worthy. No all it did was make me less concerned whether the next holiday could be paid for. I was spending money just as easily, buying stuff and using less stuff. I owned more stuff but was using less of the stuff I had. That is rightout weird? Why would anyone want this?

I remember this moment pretty good, I came across this podcast about minimalism, watched some documentaries about the subject and knew from that moment that was one of my problems. I didn't need all that stuff I was hoarding. No I wasn't a real hoarder, but I mean, picture this: I could wear every piece in my wardrobe once, and wouldn't have to wash for over a month.

>I could wear every piece in my wardrobe once, and wouldn't have to wash for over a month.

That is stupid, considering I always wore my favorite pieces of clothing anyway. But it's more than the just the stuff right, the desire of having money, have this stature, with the big house, multiple cars, luxury life. How is this wasting my life right now? What does really matter, and I'm sure this is something everyone in his mid-20s en 30s is asking her- of himself. This was the moment I sat down and thought about how to change this view on money and happiness. Well, the answer was simple, didn't want the financial stress and don't want to partake in that consumerism. In that way, FIRE is a philosophy for me. Financial stress, by the way, I don't mean that I'm worried about not having any money, rather it's that I don't know what to do with the money.

In order to get on FIRE, I should buy only as much as needed, which I divide in:

* stuff I need
* stuff I want

With a simple rule: if it is something I want, don't I already have it? If not, write down as if it were a letter my mother explaining why I want it.

>write down as if it were a letter my mother explaining why I want it

These simple rules make my life so easy. For example, my bluetooth headphones broke at the beginning of this year. First, it was only visual damage, non-technical issues. Then I almost could not resist the urge to buy these fancy noise-cancelling headphones. But I told myself, dude, they work perfectly fine, just wear them until they break down. Being honest, I was kinda ashamed using these headphones, with the shell covers almost all peeled off. But then, after a few more months, the left ear cup didn't work, I tried to look for a fix, but these headphones aren't produced anymore (last one produced in 2010) so the parts I needed where hard to get. Aaaaaaand that was the moment I said to myself, dude now you overreacting with the minimalism. Write that letter to your mom, I think you can defend it and buy a new one.
And so I did. With the headphones used until broken, it felt pretty good to get rid of the old one. It lasted for over 8 years, with regular use (couple days/week) and now I had the perfect reason to buy my fancy headphones I'd now not only wanted, but also needed in my life.

Funny how these things work out. So I try to follow these rules, stick to my plan and I'll never have financial stress. Since I now know what I'll be using the money for, it's for my FIRE.
