`Together to FIRE, I hope`

My girlfriend must find me an annoying brat sometimes. Considering how much time I talk about FIRE and all that's related, she could not care less. On the flipside I can’t stop talking (to myself), reading, thinking about a topic when I like it. You should ask her (but how?), she must be getting sick of it by now. However, after reading some lump sum vs euro cost averaging (see what I did there) investing strategies I wanted that the inheritance my girlfriend, her grandfolks died a while back, was put to good use.
>To lump sum it!
> ~ *The Dividend Nerd 2018*

I was curious what she'd wanted to do with it, what the sum of it was because I'd like to show her some calculations based on historic yields (with those nasty recessions and corrections ofcourse). 

>That is when she said OK you are right, this is probably stupid. 

We've been together since we're teenagers, well over 10 years ago, and we're really open to eachother on any kind of topic. I don't mind asking things about money, so that's what I did. She told me the number of her savings accounts, including the one with the inheritance and I was kind of amazed. Even without the inheritane she'd accumulated a whole lot of cash. Why I'm amazed is because she just started working the end of 2016, working her way through university, wanting to become a doctor. She'd only work a parttime job a few years when she didn't intern (about 2 years working 8-10 hours a week ain't much). Since I wasn't that good with money at all, just about early 2016 it startled me I was doing things wrong. However, we're sidetracking here. So resumé, she'd managed to save a bunch, collected an inheritance, and she'd let it sit idle on her savings account, with about little to no interest rates. 

That is when I brought up the inflation argument, that her stash is essentially slow cooking due to capital taxes and inflation. Surprisingly that inflation part got to her, she was shocked to see how easily her stash of cash was diminishing over time, leaving her with about the same amount of euros, but that euros could buy a whole lot less in the future. That is when, and I hope you can relate, I made the finishing kick: she was giving up *multiple* new Fred de la Bretoniere shoes every year, or the equivalent of a mid-week or week (depending on the time of year) to our beloved southern French coast we like to reside. That is when she said OK you are right, this is probably stupid. 

You can imagine the tremendous win for me. Having her show some interest, or rather showed me she cared about all this stuff I am working so hard for. 

But, now comes the hard part, I’ve yet to convince her to invest that lump sum and that she’ll do fine. She just has to learn to not touch that lump sum. And when all goes well, she probably never need touch it, since that money will work for us until the end of days (hopefully).

She is kind of risk averse, not like me (like when I saw a Tesla vanish, `go crypto!` earlier this year). The real challenge therefore, is to educate her that the market always goes up, that passive investing in low cost index funds is rationally and absolutely the best way to invest long term. Next, she need not be panicked by this, she needs to believe she will be alright when shit hits the fan. This, this is the part I should focus on, this is the main part of the strategy that causes 50% of all individual investors to have less returns. They *know* they should not panic sell, but when psychology comes to play, it can work evil magic upon humans. So I can't emphasize this enough, even when you've figured it all out, you're still not there, because you won't know what a market drop of -20% or even -50% will do to you, even though you know in the back of your head that it'll be allright, over time. Famous blogger [jlcollins wrote a real nice post](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2018/03/16/stocks-part-xxxii-why-you-should-not-be-in-the-stock-market/) on this matter, which I encourage you to read.

 I think she should be on a slightly bigger stash of cash compared to me. I am comfortable with a 5-10k buffer, preferably in the upper range. For her I’m thinking that around 15k will suffice, so together we’ve enough cash to go through a whole year of expenses! Since 25k is about what we spend each year. 

>it’s about living a live worth living, and that is where you put all your efforts in anyways

I expect that when I lay this down in front of her, she’ll get the market perspective, she need not panic when the market drops, because we’ve a decent cash buffer. Moreover we both have a steady stream of income of which we save about 50% currently. My belief is she’ll assess this on her own, then with her father, who then says: T. worked it out pretty well, on the long term it is solid, but think of the risks, bonds could smoothen the ride though, why don't think about that, or probably a house, which acts as a decent inflation hedge. But in the end, even when you lose everything, you’ll still have eachother. You will still be able to set your inventive and bright minds to work. Actually, it’s about living a live worth living, and that is where you put all your efforts in anyways. You need not focus on money, that's not what brings value in your lives.

Again, I think, or actually hope this is what he’ll say. When she does ask him, I’ll share his reaction with you guys, maybe my judgement is far off, who knows.

Lastyle, the following comes to question: when you, or we, don’t care about money, why are we firing up our fire anyway? If everything is gone tomorrow, we would not care, of course it will suck, big time. But we'll still have a roof over our heads, we can get work virtually everywhere, we’ve invested a lot in ourselves, resulting in several university and postdoctoral degrees. The idea of losing it all sucks, but I still can do so many other things and is gives me more reasong to pursue those things in life because I *want* them to. 

That is what this journey has brought me, it provided insight as to what I value most in life, especially the power of relationships and the love of life itself.

Thanks.

Later,
