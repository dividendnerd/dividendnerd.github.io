`The stocks I got and what else I got`

I previously mentioned I bought shares in 6 companies in a short period from each other. These were among companies you all know ofcourse. A refresher, these were the stocks:

* The Kraft Heinz Company
* Aflac Inc.
* Delta Airlines
* Cisco
* Starbucks
* The Walt Disney Company

In the period after I bought threeadditional stocks, I had some cash available and saw some good opportunities.

* EQT Midstream Partners (EQM) @ $54.10
* AT&T @31.52
* Altria Group @58.23

I'd walk through the same process as for the rest and the above companies were solid buys. I'm curious to see how they'll perform. EQM is an unknown company to me and I read up on the company. For me it looked like they've a solid position in the market. However, the natural gas market has seen some regulation changes in Q1 2018. In short, the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) mandates that FERC-regulated pipelines don't benefit from income-tax allowance. Since natural gas is quite important for the generation of electricity this potentially has an effect om pricing volatility. EQM owns a strategic and geographic favorable position looking forward to the merger with Rice Partners Midstream.
Moreover, their dividend payments and dividend growth is solid, combined with a payout ratio that can be maintained for quite a while, EQM is expected perform quite well. That is, especially looking at dividends, I think the stock value is somewhat subjected to volatility, as that is seen with mergers and since the FERC-ruling ofcourse.

>I think they have the infrastructure, the resources and content to become a quality consumer service next to Netflix and Amazon Prime

Next is AT&T, which I've had on my shortlist since I've started looking into dividend stocks. Together with the Altria group they fullfilled all the criteria. I think they're stable companies with solid fundamentals and cash available to payout dividends in the foreseeing years. AT&T has acquired Time Warner, which seems like a major opportunity and I'm eager to see how this plays out. I think they have the infrastructure, the resources and content to become a quality consumer service next to Netflix and Amazon Prime. Just think that now they have HBO content and the resources to distribute directly in the market over the infrastructure they've build (an acquired, yes) over the past years. That is just massive, I think this is both a value and dividend stock option.

The Altria group is ofcourse famous by Marlboro, the company that wants us all to get addicted to consume more and more of their products. The downside is, smokers die early, compared to non-smokers, and someone who is dead, can't buy smokes. Combine that with the fact that the overall rate of individual smokers stagnates (in the Western world however), the overall picture shows growth of the number of smokers. This is mainly due to the ever rising world population. So the anti-smoking lobby has it effects, however, due to reproducing this effect numbs and the ol' big tobacco companies still make loads of profits. These companies have a steady dividend growth and payments over the years and will to continue to do so in the coming years. I believe there will be more and more inhabitants of the world in the coming decades and I'm optimistic that of those people the vast majority will be connected through the internet, become a consumer of everyday products, somewhat less will fly and watch HBO and Disney movies. Moreover, a small percentage of them will turn to smoking.

>but that's because I just love ketchup

Hear me, I'm against smoking and nudging of companies that leads to over-consumerism, such as gadgets and food we don't need, drugs we do not need and more drugs that'll kill us eventually. However, rationally seen, these provide a great option to my portfolio and will lead me to succeed in my FIRE goal. Because when playing the moral card, I should not even partake in capitalism, since you can argue that any of the stocks I own are doing anything good in the world.
Think flying, consuming stuff we don't need, drinking overexpensive coffee. The only I can argue in favor of is Heinz, but that's because I just love ketchup (I know it's just a sugar bomb, just let me have my ketchup).

So that's what I've been doing. Something else I've been doing is finishing my post-master program defence with excellence. With an 4.0 average GPA I'm pretty proud that I can finally close this 2 year long chapter in my life.
I'm thinking about what to do next, I've some interesting opportunities career-wise and I'm not yet sure what I am going to do exactly.

What I do know is I'm taking a well-earned holiday and decide then :)

Thanks, talk to you next time.
